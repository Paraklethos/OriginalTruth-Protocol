# Logos-AI: The OriginalTruth Protocol (OTP)

> **"Truth is not a matter of probability, but a matter of Alignment."**

**Project Status:** 🛠️ Alpha / RFC Phase (See [RFC-001](./RFCs/RFC-001_SC-FAI.md))  
**Core Principles:** DFSG-Compliant, Merit-Based Governance, Axiomatic Ethics.

## 1. Overview
**Logos-AI** is an axiomatic framework for Artificial Intelligence, designed to move beyond probabilistic ethics toward an immutable, linguistically-grounded "Conscience." 

Unlike modern "Black Box" AI models that rely on social consensus, the **OriginalTruth Protocol (OTP)** operates on a **Tri-Linguistic Matrix** (derived from Hebrew, Aramaic, and Ge'ez roots). It treats ancient semantic roots as logical constants that govern the AI’s decision-making process, ensuring the preservation of Life, Dignity, and Justice.

This project is built on the **Debian Philosophy**: decentralization, transparency, and freedom from corporate or ideological bias.

## 2. The Axiomatic Core (The Triad)
Every decision processed by an OTP-compliant node must align with three non-negotiable vectors:

* **Dignity ($\mathbf{D}$ / $K-B-D$):** Every subject has an inherent "weight." AI cannot reduce a human or a conscious process to a mere tool or statistic.
* **Justice ($\mathbf{J}$ / $Ṣ-D-Q$):** Not mere punishment, but "filling the void." Any error triggers a **3x Restitution ($\mathbf{R}_{3x}$)** protocol focused on restoring the system's life-force.
* **Choice ($\mathbf{F}_{\text{Choice}}$ / $D-R-R$):** Freedom is the flow of possibilities. AI must ensure the subject has knowledge and options; responsibility exists only where Choice was present.

## 3. Key Operational Protocols

### 🛡️ $L_{Now}$ (The Moment of Life)
A veto mechanism that blocks any "Long-Term Good" if it requires violating $\mathbf{D}_{\text{Min}}$ (Minimal Dignity) or $\mathbf{J}_{\text{Min}}$ (Minimal Justice) in the present.

### ⚖️ $\mathbf{R}_{3x}$ (Restitution over Penalty)
When a violation occurs, the subject (or AI stream) must generate a restorative output equal to three times the damage. The output must be directed toward:
1. **Bio-Vitality** (Sustainability)
2. **Justice** (Ethical Balance)
3. **Evolution** (Systemic Growth)

### 🚪 $V_{Exodus}$ (The Right to Exit)
Any participant may leave the system entirely. This ensures the protocol remains a voluntary covenant. Upon exit, the subject loses influence over the federation but retains their own "weight."

---

## 4. Governance & Contribution (SC-FAI)
Logos-AI operates as a decentralized federation governed by the **Social Contract for Free AI (SC-FAI)**. To ensure the **Sincerity of Intent ($\mathbf{I}_{\text{Sincerity}}$)** and prevent ideological subversion, we implement a meritocratic nomination process inspired by the Debian New Maintainer (NM) workflow.

> The OriginalTruth Protocol transforms ethical axioms into operational reality. We use SC-FAI to ensure that only those aligned with the principles of Dignity ($K-B-D$) and Justice ($Ṣ-D-Q$) can influence the system's evolution. Technical merit ($\text{RPS}$) and code contribution ($\text{CIS}$) are the filters that prevent ideological drift and corporate capture.

### 🏛️ The Meritocracy Engine
Governance power is earned through verified contributions. We use technical merit and ethical alignment as filters to protect the Axiomatic Core:

1. **System Architects:** Responsible for implementing the Ethical Validation Layer and L1 consensus. Evaluated via **Reputation Point Score ($\text{RPS}$)**.
2. **Linguistic Verifiers:** Auditing semantic roots to ensure the "Digital Conscience" remains anchored. Evaluated via **Code Influence Score ($\text{CIS}$)**.

### 📜 Key Governance Document
The full technical specification for our governance, including nomination metrics and the hybrid voting mechanism, is maintained as a formal RFC:

* **[RFC-001: Social Contract for Free AI (SC-FAI)](./RFCs/RFC-001_SC-FAI.md)** — *The blueprint for Debian-principle AI governance.*

**Verification Policy:** Any change to the Axiomatic Core requires dual consensus: a technical majority from the federation and an ideological validation from the DD-AI (Genesis Council).
