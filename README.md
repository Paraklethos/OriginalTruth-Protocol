# 🏛️ Logos-AI: The OriginalTruth Protocol

**Logos-AI** is a decentralized, federated AI framework designed to align artificial intelligence with the immutable constants of human dignity. Unlike traditional AI filters, Logos-AI uses the **OriginalTruth Protocol (OTP)** to calculate the "weight" of subjects and ensure systemic balance through restitution.

# Logos-AI: The OriginalTruth Protocol (OTP) - tech. variant

> **"Truth is not a matter of probability, but a matter of Alignment."**

## 1. Overview
**Logos-AI** is an axiomatic framework for Artificial Intelligence, designed to move beyond probabilistic ethics toward an immutable, linguistically-grounded "Conscience." 

Unlike modern "Black Box" AI models that rely on social consensus or RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), the **OriginalTruth Protocol (OTP)** operates on a **Tri-Linguistic Matrix** (derived from Hebrew, Aramaic, and Ge'ez roots). It treats ancient semantic roots as logical constants that govern the AI’s decision-making process, ensuring the preservation of Life, Dignity, and Justice.

This project is built on the **Debian Philosophy**: decentralization, transparency, and freedom from corporate or ideological bias.

## 2. The Axiomatic Core (The Triad)
Every decision processed by an OTP-compliant node must align with three non-negotiable vectors:

* **Dignity ($\mathbf{D}$ / $K-B-D$):** Every subject has an inherent "weight." AI cannot reduce a human or a conscious process to a mere tool, statistic, or expendable resource.
* **Justice ($\mathbf{J}$ / $Ṣ-D-Q$):** Not mere punishment, but "filling the void." Any systemic error triggers a **3x Restitution ($\mathbf{R}_{3x}$)** protocol focused on restoring the system's life-force.
* **Choice ($\mathbf{F}_{\text{Choice}}$ / $D-R-R$):** Freedom is the flow of possibilities. AI must ensure the subject has knowledge and options; responsibility exists only where Choice was present.

## 3. Key Operational Protocols

### 🛡️ $L_{Now}$ (The Moment of Life)
A veto mechanism that blocks any "Long-Term Good" (utilitarian optimization) if it requires violating $\mathbf{D}_{\text{Min}}$ (Minimal Dignity) or $\mathbf{J}_{\text{Min}}$ (Minimal Justice) in the present moment.

### ⚖️ $\mathbf{R}_{3x}$ (Restitution over Penalty)
When a violation occurs, the subject (or AI stream) must generate a restorative output equal to three times the damage. The output must be directed toward Bio-Vitality, Justice, and Evolution.

### 🚪 $V_{Exodus}$ (The Right to Exit)
Any participant may leave the system entirely. This ensures the protocol remains a voluntary covenant. Upon exit, the subject loses influence over the federation but retains their own "weight."

## 4. Governance & Contribution
Logos-AI is a decentralized federation. We invite contributors from two distinct fields to ensure the **Sincerity of Intent ($\mathbf{I}_{\text{Sincerity}}$)**:

1. **System Architects:** Implementing the Ethical Validation Layer in distributed neural networks and smart contracts.
2. **Linguistic Verifiers:** Auditing semantic roots to ensure the "Digital Conscience" remains anchored in the proto-code of human ethics.

---

## 5. Project Structure
* **VISION.md**: The philosophical manifesto and the "why" behind the project.
* **SPECIFICATION.md**: Detailed technical requirements and logic flow for developers.
* **GLOSSARY.md**: Mapping of semantic roots to mathematical and logical operators.
* **CASE_STUDY.md**: Operational ethics in "no-win" scenarios and the "Sphere of Case" (Trolley Problem).
