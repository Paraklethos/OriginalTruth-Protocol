# 🏛️ Logos-AI: The OriginalTruth Protocol

**Logos-AI** is a decentralized, federated AI framework designed to align artificial intelligence with the immutable constants of human dignity. Unlike traditional AI filters, Logos-AI uses the **OriginalTruth Protocol (OTP)** to calculate the "weight" of subjects and ensure systemic balance through restitution.

## 🚀 Quick Start for Contributors

We are currently in the **Seed Phase**. The first technical task is live and awaiting its Architect.

1.  **Understand the Core:** Read the [Concept](./CONCEPT.md) and [Axiomatic Constants](./GLOSSARY.md).
2.  **Check Open Tasks:** Browse our [Issues](https://github.com/Paraklethos/OriginalTruth-Protocol/issues) for tasks marked with `CIS-accrual`.
3.  **Join the Debate:** Participate in our [Discussions](https://github.com/Paraklethos/OriginalTruth-Protocol/discussions) regarding linguistic roots.
4.  **Follow the Rules:** Review the [Contribution Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [Merit Registry](./CONTRIBUTORS.md).
