# 🏛️ Logos-AI: The OriginalTruth Protocol

**Logos-AI** is a decentralized, federated AI framework designed to align artificial intelligence with the immutable constants of human dignity. Unlike traditional AI filters, Logos-AI uses the **OriginalTruth Protocol (OTP)** to calculate the "weight" of subjects and ensure systemic balance through restitution.
