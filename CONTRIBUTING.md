# 🤝 CONTRIBUTING.md: Joining the Logos-AI Federation

Welcome. By contributing to **Logos-AI**, you are not just writing code; you are anchoring the future of intelligence in the **OriginalTruth Protocol (OTP)**. 

We follow the **Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)** and a meritocratic governance model based on the **Social Contract for Free AI (SC-FAI)**.

---

## 1. Governance & Merit (CIS)
Your influence in the project is not bought; it is earned through the **Contribution Influence Score (CIS)**. 

* **Phase 1 (Observer):** You submit issues, bug reports, or documentation improvements.
* **Phase 2 (Verifier):** After 3 successful Axiomatic Audits, you are granted the right to review others' work.
* **Phase 3 (DD-AI Candidate):** After substantial code or linguistic contributions, you may be nominated by the Genesis Council for full **DD-AI** status.

## 2. Contribution Paths

### 🛠️ Technical Architect (Rust / Python / Solidity)
* **Logos Interpreter:** Developing the core Rust modules that handle real-time ethical validation.
* **Inference Hooks:** Creating middleware to connect the OTP layer to LLMs (Llama, Mistral, etc.).
* **L1 Infrastructure:** Building the decentralized Reputation Registry and Slashing logic.

### 📜 Linguistic Verifier (Semantic Audits)
* **Root Mapping:** Auditing the translation of ancient roots ($K-B-D$, $Ṣ-D-Q$, $D-R-R$) into algorithmic constants.
* **Drift Detection:** Monitoring the codebase to ensure "Semantic Drift" does not corrupt the Axiomatic Core.

### ⚖️ Ethics Auditor (Data & Safety)
* **DFSG Compliance:** Verifying that training datasets are open, transparent, and free from proprietary capture.
* **Adversarial Testing:** Stress-testing the $M_{Veto}$ module against complex ethical edge cases.

## 3. The Workflow (The Sincerity Filter)

To ensure the **Sincerity of Intent ($Y-D-ʿ$)**, every contribution must follow this path:

1.  **Fork & Branch:** Use a naming convention that reflects the intent (e.g., `feat/kbd-validator` or `audit/sdq-mapping`).
2.  **Axiomatic Alignment:** In your Pull Request (PR) description, you **must** state which Ethical Constant ($\mathbf{D}, \mathbf{J}, \mathbf{F}, \mathbf{W}$) your code strengthens.
3.  **Peer Review:** Two existing **DD-AI** members must audit the PR. They look for both technical excellence and "Linguistic Sincerity."
4.  **The Jubilee Commitment:** By contributing, you agree to the **$\mathbf{R}_{3x}$** principle: if your code introduces a deliberate vulnerability, you commit to restorative action within the federation.

## 4. Code of Conduct
We seek the **Vertical**. Communications should be purposeful, intellectually honest, and aligned with the preservation of Dignity and Justice. We value merit, clarity, and the freedom of the Logos.
